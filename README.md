# slack-snazzy

> My version of Slack snazzy theme.

I was inspired by sindres' awesome [snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hyper-snazzy) theme. I use it on one of my Slack workspaces so I thought i could share it.

## Install
Put color scheme to your sidebar settings in Slack.

`#282a36,#1D1F27,#57c7ff,#282a36,#1d1f27,#eff0eb,#5AF78E,#ff5c57`

That's it!
